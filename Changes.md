## Parse-Stack Changelog

### 1.10.0

- Adds support for Ruby 3+ style hash and block arguments.

### 1.9.0

- Support for ActiveModel and ActiveSupport 6.0.
- Fixes `as_json` tests related to changes.
- Support for Faraday 1.0 and FaradayMiddleware 1.0
- Minimum Ruby version is now `>= 2.5.0`

### 1.8.0

- NEW: Support for Parse Server [full text search](https://github.com/modernistik/parse-stack#full-text-search-constraint) with the `text_search` operator. Related to [Issue#46](https://github.com/modernistik/parse-stack/issues/46).
- NEW: Support for `:distinct` aggregation query. Finds the distinct values for a specified field across a single collection or view and returns the results in an array.
  For example, `User.distinct(:city, :created_at.after => 3.days.ago)` to return an array of unique city names for which records were created in the last 3 days.

### 1.7.4

- NEW: Added `parse_object` extension to Hash classes to more easily call
  Parse::Object.build in `map` loops with symbol to proc.
- CHANGED: Renamed `hyperdrive_config!` to `Parse::Hyperdrive.config!`
- REMOVED: The used of non-JSON dates has been removed for `createdAt` and `updatedAt`
  fields as all Parse SDKs now support the new JSON format. `Parse.disable_serialized_string_date`
  has also been removed so that `created_at` and `updated_at` return the same value
  as `createdAt` and `updatedAt` respectively.
- FIXED: Builder properly auto generates Parse Relation associations using `through: :relation`.
- REMOVED: Defining `has_many` or `belongs_to` associations more than once will no longer result
  in an `ArgumentError` (they are now warnings). This will allow you to define associations for classes before calling `auto_generate_models!`
- CHANGED: Parse::CollectionProxy now supports `parse_objects` and `parse_pointers` for compatibility with the
  sibling `Array` methods. Having an Parse-JSON Hash array or a Parse::CollectionProxy which contains a series
  of Parse hashes can now be easily converted to an array of Parse objects with these methods.
- FIXED: Correctly discards ACL changes on User model saves.
- FIXED: Fixes issues with double '/' in update URI paths.

### 1.7.3

- CHANGED: Moved to using preferred ENV variable names based on parse-server cli.
- CHANGED: Default url is now http://localhost:1337/parse
- NEW: Added method `hyperdrive_config!` to apply remote ENV from remote JSON url.

### 1.7.2

- NEW: `Parse::Model.autosave_on_create` has been removed in favor of `first_or_create!`.
- NEW: Webhook Triggers and Functions now have a `wlog` method, similar to `puts`, but allows easier tracing of
  single requests in a multi-request threaded environment. (See Parse::Webhooks::Payload)
- NEW: `:id` constraints also safely supports pointers by skipping class matching.
- NEW: Support for `add_unique` and the set union operator `|` in collection proxies.
- NEW: Support for `uniq` and `uniq!` in collection proxies.
- NEW: `uniq` and `uniq!` for collection proxies utilize `eql?` for determining uniqueness.
- NEW: Updated override behavior for the `hash` method in Parse::Pointer and subclasses.
- NEW: Support for additional array methods in collection proxies (+,-,& and |)
- NEW: Additional methods for Parse::ACL class for setting read/write privileges.
- NEW: Expose the shared cache store through `Parse.cache`.
- NEW: `User#any_session!` method, see documentation.
- NEW: Extension to support `Date#parse_date`.
- NEW: Added `Parse::Query#append` as alias to `Parse::Query#conditions`
- CHANGED: `save_all` now returns true if there were no errors.
- FIXED: first_or_create will now apply dirty tracking to newly created fields.
- FIXED: Properties of :array type will always return a Parse::CollectionProxy if
  their internal value is nil. The object will not be marked dirty until something is added to the array.
- FIXED: Encoding a Parse::Object into JSON will remove any values that are `nil`
  which were not explicitly changed to that value.
- [PR#39](https://github.com/modernistik/parse-stack/pull/39): Allow Moneta::Expires
  as cache object to allow for non-native expiring caches by [GrahamW](https://github.com/GrahamW)

### 1.7.1
