  # ** BREAKING CHANGES **
  #  The default `has_many` association form has changed from :array to :query.
  #  To use arrays, you must now pass `through: :array` option to `has_many`.

  #  Visit: https://github.com/modernistik/parse-stack/wiki/Changes-to-has_many-in-1.5.0

  # UPGRADE
end

## Development
# After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can
# also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
#
# To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
# To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
# `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version,
# push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
