module Parse
  # Defines all the types of Parse object associations.
  module Associations
    # This association creates a one-to-one association with another Parse model.
    # BelongsTo relation is the simplies association in which the local
    # Parse table constrains a column that has a Parse::Pointer to a foreign table record.
    #
    # This association says that this class contains a foreign pointer column
    # which references a different class. Utilizing the `belongs_to` method in
    # defining a property in a Parse::Object subclass sets up an association
    # between the local table and a foreign table. Specifying the `belongs_to`
    # in the class, tells the framework that the Parse table contains a local
    # column in its schema that has a reference to a record in a foreign table.
    # The argument to `belongs_to` should be the singularized version of the
    # foreign Parse::Object class. you should specify the foreign table as the
    # snake_case singularized version of the foreign table class.
    #
    # Note that the reverse relationship on the foreign class is not generated automatically.
    # You can use a `has_one` on the foreign model to create it.
    # @example
    #  class Author < Parse::Object
    #  	property :name
    #  end
    #
    #
    #  class Post < Parse::Object
    #  	belongs_to :author
    #  end
    #
    #  Post.references # => {:author=>"Author"}
    #
    #  post = Post.first
    #  post.author? # => true if has a pointer
    #
    #  # Follow the author pointer and get name
    #  post.author.name
    #
    #  other_author = Author.first
    #  # change author by setting new pointer
    #  post.author = other_author
    #  post.save

      #  @return [Hash]

      # @!method self.belongs_to(key, opts = {})
      # Creates a one-to-one association with another Parse model.
      # @param [Symbol] key The singularized version of the foreign class and the name of the
      #   local column in the remote Parse table where the pointer is stored.
      # @option opts [Symbol] :field override the name of the remote column
      #  where the pointer is stored. By default this is inferred as
      #  the columnized of the key parameter.
      # @option opts [Symbol] :as override the inferred Parse::Object subclass.
      #  By default this is inferred as the singularized camel case version of
      #  the key parameter. This option allows you to override the typecast of
      #  foreign Parse model of the association, while allowing you to have a
      #  different accessor name.
      # @option opts [Boolean] :required Setting to `true`, automatically creates
      #   an ActiveModel validation of `validates_presence_of` for the
      #   association. This will not prevent the save, but affects the validation
      #   check when `valid?` is called on an instance. Default is false.
      # @example
      #  # Assumes 'Artist' is foreign class.
      #  belongs_to :artist
      #
      #  # uses Parse::User as foreign class
      #  belongs_to :manager, as: :user
      #
      #  # sets attribute name to `featured_song` for foreign class Song with the remote
      #  # column name in Parse as 'theFeaturedSong'.
      #  belongs_to :featured_song, as: :song, field: :theFeaturedSong
      #
      # @see String#columnize
      # @see #key?
      # @return [Parse::Object] a Parse::Object subclass when using the accessor
      #  when fetching the association.

      # @!method key?
      # A dynamically generated method based on the value of `key` passed to the
      # belongs_to method, which returns true if this instance has a pointer for
      # this field.
      # @example
      #
      #  class Post < Parse::Object
      #  	belongs_to :author # generates 'author?'
      #  end
      #
      #  post = Post.new

      #  post.author = Author.new
